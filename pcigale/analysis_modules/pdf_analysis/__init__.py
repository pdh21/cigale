"""
Probability Density Function analysis module
============================================

This module builds the probability density functions (PDF) of the SED
parameters to compute their moments.

The models corresponding to all possible combinations of parameters are
computed and their fluxes in the same filters as the observations are
integrated. These fluxes are compared to the observed ones to compute the
χ² value of the fitting. This χ² give a probability that is associated with
the model values for the parameters.

At the end, for each parameter, the probability-weighted mean and standard
deviation are computed and the best fitting model (the one with the least
reduced χ²) is given for each observation.
