"""
This class represents a Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) as used by pcigale.
Such SED is characterised by:

- sfh: the Star Formation History of the galaxy.

- modules: a list of tuples (module name, parameter dictionary) containing all
  the pcigale modules the SED 'went through'.

- wavelength_grid: the grid of wavelengths [nm] used for the luminosities.

- contribution_names: the list of the names of the luminosity contributions
  making part of the SED.

- luminosities: a two axis numpy array containing all the luminosity density
  [W/nm] contributions to the SED. The index in the first axis corresponds to
  the contribution (in the contribution_names list) and the index of the
  second axis corresponds to the wavelength in the wavelength grid.

- info: a dictionary containing various information about the SED.

- mass_proportional_info: the set of keys in the info dictionary whose value
  is proportional to the galaxy mass.
